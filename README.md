# How to conduct a simulation study

This is an example/template of a simple simulation study in `R`.

In this example, we want to estimate the performance
of a kernel-based estimator of the conditional mean.


It is composed of the following files:

- `functions.R`: contains the functions necessary to do the estimation.

- `simulation.R`: the R script to run to do the simulations and save them as a csv file.

- `loadingData.R`: the R script that read the csv file and process it.

- `analysingSimulations.Rmd`: the R Markdown script that produces the figures and tables.
